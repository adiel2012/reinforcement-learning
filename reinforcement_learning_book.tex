% Part I: Mathematical Foundations
\part{Mathematical Foundations}

This part establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for understanding reinforcement learning from both theoretical and engineering perspectives. We begin with essential mathematical prerequisites, develop the formal framework of Markov Decision Processes, and conclude with classical dynamic programming methods.

The treatment emphasizes mathematical rigor while maintaining practical relevance for engineering applications. Each concept is developed with careful attention to assumptions, proofs, and connections to control theory and optimization.

% Part II: Function Approximation
\part{Function Approximation}

This part extends reinforcement learning beyond tabular methods to handle large and continuous state spaces through function approximation. We explore advanced temporal difference methods, develop linear function approximation with rigorous convergence analysis, and culminate with neural network approaches that enable deep reinforcement learning.

The transition from exact to approximate methods introduces new challenges including the deadly triad of function approximation, bootstrapping, and off-policy learning. We address these challenges with careful algorithm design and theoretical analysis.

% Part III: Policy Methods
\part{Policy Methods}

This part develops policy-based reinforcement learning methods that directly optimize policies rather than value functions. We begin with policy gradient methods and the policy gradient theorem, develop actor-critic algorithms that combine policy and value function learning, and conclude with advanced policy optimization techniques.

Policy methods are particularly important for continuous control problems and provide the foundation for many state-of-the-art algorithms. We emphasize both theoretical understanding and practical implementation considerations.
