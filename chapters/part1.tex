\part{Mathematical Foundations}

This part establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for understanding reinforcement learning from both theoretical and engineering perspectives. We begin with essential mathematical prerequisites, then develop the formal framework of Markov Decision Processes, and conclude with classical dynamic programming methods that form the basis for modern reinforcement learning algorithms.

The treatment emphasizes mathematical rigor while maintaining practical relevance for engineering applications. Each concept is developed with careful attention to assumptions, proofs, and connections to control theory and optimization.
