\part{Advanced Topics}

This part explores advanced reinforcement learning topics that extend beyond the basic framework to handle more complex scenarios. We examine continuous control problems that arise frequently in engineering applications, multi-agent systems where multiple learners interact, model-based approaches that learn environment dynamics, and the fundamental exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

These advanced topics require sophisticated mathematical tools and careful analysis of convergence properties, stability, and sample complexity. The treatment provides both theoretical insights and practical guidance for tackling complex real-world problems.
