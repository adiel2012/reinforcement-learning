\part{Function Approximation}

This part extends reinforcement learning beyond tabular methods to handle large and continuous state spaces through function approximation. We begin with advanced temporal difference methods, then develop linear function approximation with rigorous convergence analysis, and culminate with neural network approaches that enable deep reinforcement learning.

The transition from exact to approximate methods introduces new challenges including the deadly triad of function approximation, bootstrapping, and off-policy learning. We address these challenges with careful algorithm design and theoretical analysis.
