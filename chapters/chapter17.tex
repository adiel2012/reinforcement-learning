\label{ch:real-world-applications}

\begin{keyideabox}[Chapter Overview]
This chapter bridges the gap between RL research and real-world deployment by examining practical applications, safety considerations, robustness requirements, and engineering challenges. We cover successful deployments in robotics, autonomous systems, finance, healthcare, and other domains, while addressing the critical concerns of safety, reliability, and scalability that arise when moving from laboratory settings to production environments.

\begin{intuitionbox}[From Lab to Life]
Consider the difference between a chess AI playing millions of games against itself versus an autonomous vehicle navigating real traffic. The chess AI operates in a perfectly known, deterministic environment with clear rules and objectives. The autonomous vehicle faces unpredictable human drivers, varying weather conditions, sensor failures, and life-or-death consequences for mistakes. This transition from controlled environments to messy reality is where the true challenges of RL deployment lie - not just in algorithmic performance, but in safety, robustness, and engineering reliability.

\section{Safety in Reinforcement Learning}

\subsection{Safe Exploration}

Ensure safety during learning phase:

\textbf{Constrained Policy Search:}
\begin{equation}
\max_\pi \mathbb{E}_\pi[R(s,a)] \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathbb{E}_\pi[C(s,a)] \leq \delta
\end{equation}

where $C(s,a)$ represents safety constraints.

\textbf{Safe Policy Improvement:}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Safe Policy Improvement}
\begin{algorithmic}
\REQUIRE Safety threshold $\delta$, baseline policy $\pi_0$
\FOR{iteration $k$}
    \STATE Propose new policy $\pi_k$
    \STATE Estimate safety: $\hat{C}_k = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_k}[C(s,a)]$
    \IF{$\hat{C}_k \leq \delta$ with high confidence}
        \STATE Deploy $\pi_k$
    \ELSE
        \STATE Keep $\pi_{k-1}$ or revert to $\pi_0$
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm>

\subsection{Constrained MDPs}

Formalize safety as constraints:

\begin{equation}
V_C^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t C(s_t, a_t) \bigg| s_0 = s \right]
\end{equation}

\textbf{Lagrangian Approach:}
\begin{equation}
L(\pi, \lambda) = J(\pi) - \lambda(V_C^\pi(s_0) - \delta)
\end{equation}

\pi_{k+1} &= \arg\max_\pi J(\pi) - \lambda_k V_C^\pi(s_0) \\
\lambda_{k+1} &= \max(0, \lambda_k + \alpha(V_C^{\pi_{k+1}}(s_0) - \delta))
\end{align>

\subsection{Robust RL

Handle uncertainty in environment dynamics:

\textbf{Robust MDP:}
\begin{equation}
V^*(s) = \max_a \min_{P \in \mathcal{U}(s,a)} \left[ R(s,a) + \gamma \sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) V^*(s') \right]
\end{equation>

where $\mathcal{U}(s,a)$ is the uncertainty set for transitions.

\textbf{Distributionally Robust RL:}
\begin{equation}
\max_\pi \min_{P \in \mathcal{P}} \mathbb{E}_P [R(\tau)]
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of possible environment models.
