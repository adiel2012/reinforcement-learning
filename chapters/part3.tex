\part{Policy Methods}

This part develops policy-based reinforcement learning methods that directly optimize policies rather than value functions. We begin with policy gradient methods and the policy gradient theorem, then develop actor-critic algorithms that combine policy and value function learning, and conclude with advanced policy optimization techniques used in modern deep reinforcement learning.

Policy methods are particularly important for continuous control problems and provide the foundation for many state-of-the-art algorithms. We emphasize both theoretical understanding and practical implementation considerations.
