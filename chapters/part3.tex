\part{Function Approximation and Deep Learning}

This part bridges classical reinforcement learning with modern deep learning approaches. When state and action spaces are large or continuous, exact representation of value functions becomes intractable. Function approximation provides the mathematical framework for representing value functions compactly while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

We begin with linear function approximation, which provides strong theoretical foundations and convergence guarantees. We then explore the integration of neural networks into reinforcement learning, leading to the deep reinforcement learning revolution. Finally, we develop policy gradient methods that directly optimize parameterized policies.

The treatment emphasizes both the mathematical foundations that ensure stability and convergence, and the practical considerations necessary for successful implementation in engineering systems.
