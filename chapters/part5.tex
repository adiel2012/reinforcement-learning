\part{Applications and Frontiers}

This part focuses on the practical aspects of implementing and deploying reinforcement learning systems, as well as emerging research directions. Moving from theory to practice requires careful consideration of transfer learning, real-world deployment challenges, and future research frontiers.

We examine transfer learning and meta-learning for efficient adaptation, real-world applications across various domains, and emerging research directions that will shape the future of reinforcement learning. The treatment emphasizes both current practical considerations and future possibilities.
